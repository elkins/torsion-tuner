# TorsionTuner: GNN-Based Protein Structure Refinement

The **TorsionTuner** is a specialized machine learning tool designed to bridge the gap between "idealized" static protein structures (like those from AlphaFold) and "dynamic" solution-state experimental data (SAXS/NMR). 

By utilizing a JAX-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a differentiable kinematics layer, the model applies subtle adjustments to the backbone dihedral angles ($\phi/\psi$) to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted structure and real experimental observables.

## 🔬 Theoretical Foundations

### 1. The Torsional Prediction Strategy
Instead of predicting 3D coordinates ($x, y, z$) directly—which can easily break chemical constraints like bond lengths—this model predicts **torsional deltas** ($\Delta\phi, \Delta\psi$). 
*   **Advantage:** By keeping bond lengths and bond angles fixed to their idealized values, we ensure the resulting structure is always chemically valid.
*   **Input:** Initial backbone angles from an AlphaFold PDB.
*   **Output:** Small angular adjustments that "nudge" the protein into a conformation that fits the data.

### 2. Differentiable Kinematics (NeRF)
To calculate a loss against experimental data, we convert the predicted angles back into 3D coordinates using the **Natural Extension Reference Frame (NeRF)** algorithm, implemented in JAX.
*   **Forward Pass:** Angles $\rightarrow$ 3D Coordinates $\rightarrow$ Simulated Observables (SAXS/NMR).
*   **Backward Pass:** Gradients flow from the experimental loss back through the kinematics layer to the GNN weights.

### 3. Multi-Objective Loss Function
The model optimizes a weighted combination of multiple experimental and structural constraints:
$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = w_{saxs}\mathcal{L}_{saxs} + w_{nmr}\mathcal{L}_{nmr} + w_{quality}\mathcal{L}_{quality} + w_{reg}\mathcal{L}_{reg}$$

*   **SAXS Loss:** Uses the Debye formula to fit Small-Angle X-ray Scattering profiles.
*   **NMR Loss:** Fits experimental $C_\alpha$ chemical shifts using a differentiable predictor.
*   **Quality Loss (ANSURR Proxy):** A soft Ramachandran penalty that ensures $\phi/\psi$ angles remain in favored regions.
*   **Regularization:** Prevents over-fitting by keeping the angular "nudges" small.

## 🏛 Research Integration (The Montelione Group Approach)
This project implements refinement strategies pioneered by the **Montelione Group** (RPI/Rutgers) for integrating AI-predicted structures with NMR data.

### 1. Chemical Shift Driven Refinement
Research shows that AlphaFold models often rival the accuracy of experimental NMR structures but can be further improved by fitting to backbone chemical shifts.
*   **Implementation:** We use differentiable $C_\alpha$ shift prediction to "nudge" models towards experimental accuracy.
*   **Reference:** *Tejero R, et al. (2022). "AlphaFold models of small proteins rival the accuracy of solution NMR structures." Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences.*

### 2. Validation with RPF-DP and ANSURR
The Montelione lab advocates for rigorous validation of refined models using "goodness-of-fit" metrics.
*   **RPF-DP:** Measures how well the 3D model fits unassigned NOESY peak lists (Recall, Precision, F-measure, and Discrimination Power).
*   **ANSURR:** Validates accuracy by comparing flexibility predicted from chemical shifts (RCI) with flexibility from the 3D structure.
*   **Reference:** *Huang YJ, et al. (2012). "RPF: a quality assessment tool for protein NMR structures." Nucleic Acids Research.*
*   **Reference:** *Fowler NJ, et al. (2020). "A method for validating the accuracy of NMR protein structures." Nature Communications.*

### 3. PSVS Suite
Refined structures should be validated using the **Protein Structure Validation Software (PSVS)** suite.
*   **Utility:** Confirms that the refinement has improved the "NMR-quality" of the prediction.
