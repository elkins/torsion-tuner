## 🌟 Why TorsionTuner?

Static snapshots of proteins, such as those from AlphaFold, often miss the subtle dynamic nuances of molecules in their natural, solution-state environments.  **TorsionTuner** bridges this gap. It is a specialized machine learning engine that "nudges" idealized structures into better agreement with real-world experimental data.

### The Problem
Traditional refinement often breaks the laws of chemistry -— bond lengths stretch and angles distort -— just to fit noisy data.

### The TorsionTuner Solution
By operating exclusively in **torsional space** ($\phi/\psi$ angles), we ensure the laws of physics are respected. Our differentiable kinematics layer allows gradients to flow from the experimental loss (SAXS/NMR) directly back into the GNN weights, creating a chemically valid, evidence-based refinement.

## ✨ Core Features

*   **🛰️ Differentiable Kinematics**: Powered by a JAX-native implementation of the Natural Extension Reference Frame (NeRF) algorithm.
*   **🧠 Geometric GNN**: An Equinox-based Graph Neural Network that captures both sequential (backbone) and spatial (3D contact) relationships.
*   **⚖️ Multi-Objective Optimization**: Simultaneously fits SAXS profiles, backbone chemical shifts, and structural geometry (Ramachandran regularization).
*   **🧪 Evidence-Based**: Rooted in refinement strategies pioneered by the **Montelione Group**.

## 📚 Glossary

*   **Dihedral Angles ($\phi, \psi$):** The rotation angles of the protein backbone that define its overall 3D fold.
*   **NeRF (Natural Extension Reference Frame):** An algorithm used to convert internal coordinates (angles/lengths) into 3D Cartesian coordinates.
*   **CSRMSD:** Chemical Shift Root-Mean-Square Deviation—a measure of how well a structure fits experimental NMR data.
*   **Ramachandran Regularization:** A soft potential penalizing phi/psi values outside the favored backbone geometry regions (alpha-helix, beta-strand, left-handed alpha). Used as a training-time regularizer; analogous to the Ramachandran terms in CNS and Rosetta. For post-refinement backbone quality assessment, see PROCHECK or MolProbity. For NMR-specific structure accuracy validation, see ANSURR (Fowler et al. 2020, *Nature Commun.*).
*   **SAXS (Small-Angle X-ray Scattering):** A technique that provides information on the overall shape, size, and dynamics of proteins in solution.
