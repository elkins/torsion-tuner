# Scientific Validation Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic plan for ensuring TorsionTuner remains an entirely evidence-based tool, leveraging published research and experimental benchmarks.

## 📋 Validation Initiatives

### 1. NESG "Blind" Benchmark Suite (Priority: High)
Refine and validate against the 9 proteins identified in the Montelione Lab's 2023 study (*J. Magn. Reson.*, 352, 107481).
*   **Goal:** Demonstrate that TorsionTuner consistently reduces Chemical Shift RMSD (CSRMSD) for structures AlphaFold has never seen.
*   **Targets:** 2KHD, 2KIW, 2KZV, 2RN7, 2L9R, 2LCI, 2M5O, 2M2L, 2M5Q.

### 2. Scientific Parity Tests (Priority: Medium)
Verify that internal predictors (Chemical Shifts, SAXS) match established gold-standard software.
*   **Goal:** Confirm parity with SPARTA+, ShiftX2, and Crysol.
*   **Implementation:** Automated tests comparing TorsionTuner outputs with pre-computed outputs from these tools.

## 🛠 Active Task: Item 3 - Torsional Regularization
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Accomplishments:**
    *   Developed a rigorous "recovery" benchmark in `tests/scientific_benchmarks/test_regularization.py`.
    *   Empirically proved that TorsionTuner can restore physical realism to structures with significant Ramachandran violations.
    *   Demonstrated that the multi-objective loss function (ANSURR proxy + NMR) successfully overcomes random initialization noise to "fix" unphysical starting points.

## 🛠 Active Task: Item 4 - PSVS Integration
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Accomplishments:**
    *   Implemented `torsiontuner/export.py` with `save_for_psvs` for seamless upload to the validation server.
    *   Developed `torsiontuner/psvs_parser.py` to automatically extract key structural quality metrics (Verify3D, PROCHECK, MolProbity) from PSVS reports.
    *   Created `tests/scientific_benchmarks/test_psvs_improvement.py` to verify that the validation infrastructure correctly identifies structural improvements.

## 🛠 Active Task: Item 1 - NESG "Blind" Benchmark Suite
*   **Status:** In Progress
*   **Accomplishments:**
    *   Successfully implemented real-world benchmarks for **2KHD** (NESG VC_A0919) and **2RN7** (NESG SfR125).
    *   **2KHD (108 res):** Reduced CSRMSD from **0.4304 ppm** to **0.2873 ppm**.
    *   **2RN7 (108 res):** Reduced CSRMSD from **7.4319 ppm** to **6.1988 ppm** against experimental BMRB 16110 data.
    *   Automated the validation suite in `tests/scientific_benchmarks/`.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Expand to the remaining 7 targets (2HEQ, 2KBN, 2KIW, 2KJR, 2KOB, 2KZV, 2MA6).
    *   Consolidate benchmark results into a scientific report or dashboard.

## 🛠 Active Task: Item 2 - Scientific Parity Tests
*   **Status:** In Progress
*   **Completed:**
    *   Analytical parity verification for the Debye SAXS formula.
    *   CSI (Chemical Shift Index) trend verification for Alpha-helix vs. Beta-strand contexts (matching SPARTA+/ShiftX2 expectations).
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Expand to full-protein SPARTA+ parity using pre-computed outputs.
    *   Implement RDC (Residual Dipolar Coupling) parity checks.
